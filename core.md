# Java Programming Guide

This project is a Java-based framework designed to facilitate efficient message transmission between publishers and subscribers. It is built using the **FastByte** framework for high-performance in-memory data storage and serialization.

---

## Features

- **Customizable Message Transport**: Supports both in-memory and Kafka-based messaging.
- **High-Performance Serialization**: Uses FastByte for optimized data processing.
- **Modular Design**: Easy integration with different messaging systems.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in tracing for optimizing application performance.
- **Status Management**: Tools for managing the operational states of the application.

## Main Components

### 1. Platform
The `Platform` class is the entry point of the framework, providing access to all services and managing initialization.

#### Example:

// Example code for initializing Platform

### 2. Transport Core
The Transport Core component handles message creation and processing. It is tightly integrated with the FastByte framework for efficient in-memory data management and serialization.

Responsibilities:
Create and process messages.
Serialize and deserialize records.
Manage in-memory message flows.
Example:
java
Copy code
// Example code demonstrating Transport Core usage

### 3. Connector
The Connector component is responsible for message transmission between publishers and subscribers. The framework includes two types of connectors:

InMemory Connector: A lightweight connector for testing and development purposes.
Kafka Connector: A production-grade connector for large-scale messaging with Kafka.
Example:
java
Copy code
// Example code demonstrating InMemory and Kafka Connector usage
### 4. RecordSchema
The RecordSchema defines the structure of a record (message) that is published to a topic. It ensures consistency and type safety for all messages.

Example:
java
Copy code
// Example code for defining and using a RecordSchema
### 5. ApplicationStatusService
The ApplicationStatusService manages application states, providing tools to monitor health, readiness, and lifecycle.

Features:
Application health tracking.
Status updates and logging.
Service readiness checks.
Example:
java
Copy code
// Example code for using ApplicationStatusService

### 6. TracingSystem
The TracingSystem enables performance monitoring by recording execution times and other performance metrics.

Features:
Measure execution times for key operations.
Trace message processing performance.
Identify and resolve bottlenecks.

Example:

Copy code
// Example code for integrating TracingSystem
