# Messaging Framework

A Java-based framework designed to facilitate message delivery from publishers to subscribers. The framework is modular, comprising two main components: **Transport Core** and **Connector**.

---

## Features

- Modular and extensible design.
- **Transport Core**: Handles message creation, processing, and in-memory data management using a custom framework.
- **Connectors**: Manage the delivery of messages. Currently supported:
  - **InMemoryConnector**: For testing purposes.
  - **KafkaConnector**: For production-grade message delivery via Apache Kafka.

---

## Components Overview

### 1. Transport Core

The `Transport Core` is responsible for the entire lifecycle of messages, including:
- Message creation and serialization.
- Routing messages to the appropriate connector.
- Handling incoming messages from connectors.

The core leverages a custom in-memory framework for efficient data storage and serialization.

### 2. Connector
The Connector component facilitates message delivery between publishers and subscribers. Two implementations are currently available:

InMemoryConnector: A lightweight connector for testing scenarios, simulating message flow without external dependencies.
KafkaConnector: A robust connector for integrating with Apache Kafka for distributed message delivery.
